        <p>
        My name is Mayur Mendhule. I'm a Front-end Web Developer from Wardha, Maharashtra. 
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          I believe that the power of technology can make people's lives easier 
          and that new frameworks and technology make developers more productive 
          in the tech community. Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through my 
          engineering journey piqued my interest in coding. Since then, my life 
          has been about pursuing a career in coding and web development.
